this program encrypt the password of any type 

the process of encryption is given below :
Basically this program is divided in the two parts one encryption part and decryption part 

--------------------------------------Encrytion--------------------------------------------
1. Firstly the program gets the file name name which contains the passwords
2. it encryp the passwords based on the askii value 
3. the program on plays with asski values 
4. we can can the encryption algorithm by just changing the key value present in the program

This is how the encryption algorthm works 

-------------------------------------decryption--------------------------------------------
1. Decryption algorith works exacly opposit of the encryption (this also takes the file name input)
2. It just uses the key value and performs the reverse operation on the file provided.
